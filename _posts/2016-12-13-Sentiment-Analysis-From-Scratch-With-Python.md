This is a demonstration of sentiment analysis using a NLTK 2.0.4 powered text classification process. It can tell you whether it thinks the text you enter below expresses positive sentiment, negative sentiment, or if it's neutral. Using hierarchical classification, neutrality is determined first, and sentiment polarity is determined second, but only if the text is not neutral.
Test this code

``` python
try:
# Too broad!
    return handle_value(collection[key])
except KeyError:
# Will also catch KeyError raised by handle_value()
    return key_not_found(key)
```

6. if it starts with: 
Yes: `if foo.startswith('bar')`:
No: `if foo[:3] == 'bar'`


Hope this will be helpful for you.
